# Att-BiLSTM neural network for discourse sense classification
Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model for classification of Chinese implicit discourse relations.

Code developed by Samuel Rönnqvist, with contributions and comments from Farrokh Mehryary, Niko Schenk and Philip Schultz.

This repository hosts the model described in: [A Recurrent Neural Model with Attention for the Recognition of Chinese Implicit Discourse Relations]()
